        <h2>What is Gone Goat?</h2>

        <p>
          Gone Goat is a card game about chaos, mischief, and goats that never
          stay where you put them. It's easy to teach, fast to play, and gets
          louder every time someone new pulls up a chair.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each round builds tension as players read each other's moves, time
          their plays, and try not to be the one left holding everything when
          the goats finally bolt. Expect last-second saves, honest betrayals,
          and immediate demands for a rematch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everything fits in a standard poker-size tuck box — pocket-sized,
          shelf-worthy, and ready to hit the table in under five minutes.

              Hi — I'm Terry. I've been drawing, designing, and making things
              for as long as I can remember, and Gone Goat is the project I've
              been building toward without fully realizing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea started with the characters — goats with too much
              personality and nowhere to put it — and grew into a game I
              genuinely love playing with people. I'm excited to bring it to
              more tables.
